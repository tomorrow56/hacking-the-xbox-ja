## Attribution requirements (mandatory in every chapter file)

Every `docs/ja/*.md` file must include the following in its frontmatter AND in a visible footer block:

```
原著: Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering
著者: Andrew "bunnie" Huang
著作権: Copyright © 2003 by Xenatera LLC
出版: No Starch Press
ライセンス: CC BY-NC-SA 1.0
本翻訳: 非公式日本語訳（unofficial Japanese translation）
```

Never use the phrases "公式日本語版", "公認翻訳", or "正規翻訳". Always use "非公式日本語訳".

## Translation style

### Core rules
- **Faithful**: Translate every paragraph. Do not summarize, condense, or skip content.
- **Complete**: Do not omit paragraphs, sentences, footnotes, sidebars, or captions.
- **No invented text**: If source text is unclear or garbled from PDF extraction, mark with a `<!-- TODO: verify: [description] -->` comment and leave a bracketed placeholder. Do not fabricate.
- **Preserve order**: Keep all paragraphs in original order. Do not reorganize.

### What to preserve verbatim (do not translate)
- Code, assembly listings, pseudocode, shell commands
- Hexadecimal values (e.g., `0xDEADBEEF`)
- Part numbers and order numbers (e.g., `MCM order number 22-3495`)
- URLs
- Figure numbers and table numbers (e.g., `Figure 1-1`, `Table 2-1`)
- Product names, company names, brand names (e.g., Xbox, Weller WTCPT, Kester 24-6337-8802)
- US Code citations (e.g., `17 U.S.C § 1201(f)`)
- Footnote numbers (preserve as superscripts or footnote markers)

### Japanese writing style
- Use natural, readable Japanese. Avoid overly literal translations that produce unnatural phrasing.
- Technical terms: consult `glossary.tsv` first. If a term is not in the glossary, add it before translating.
- On first use of a technical term, show both Japanese and English: 例） リバースエンジニアリング (reverse engineering)
- Katakana for established loanwords (e.g., ハッカー, ソルダー, フラックス).
- Kanji compounds for native-equivalent terms where natural.
- Footnotes: translate inline as `[^N]` markdown footnotes at the bottom of the file.

### Sidebars and callout boxes
VitePress does not have a native sidebar container, so use a blockquote with a bold heading:

```markdown
> **📦 サイドバー: 静電気：回路の天敵 (Static Electricity: The Circuit Killer)**
>
> 翻訳テキスト...
```

### Notes and tips
Preserve "Note" and "Tip" callouts as:
```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> 翻訳テキスト

> [!TIP]
> 翻訳テキスト
```

## Figure and caption handling

- Preserve every figure number exactly as printed: **Figure 1-1**, **Figure 2-3**, etc.
- Translate captions into Japanese below the image tag.
- Format:
  ```markdown
  ![Figure 1-1: A selection of security bits.](/images/page-034-img-01.png)
  **図1-1**: セキュリティビットの一覧。左から右へ：任天堂4.5mm、セキュリティトルクス、...
  ```
- If the image file has not yet been extracted, use this placeholder:
  ```markdown
  <!-- TODO: insert Figure 1-1 — source: PDF page 34 -->
  ```
- Do not guess which image file corresponds to which figure. Only link images confirmed in `source/extract/figures-manifest.json`.

## Footnote handling

Original footnotes appear at the bottom of PDF pages. Collect all footnotes for a chapter and render them as markdown footnotes at the end of the file:

```markdown
[^1]: 原注: 翻訳テキスト (英語原文: "original English text")
```

Always include the original English text in parentheses after the Japanese translation.

## TODO handling

Use HTML comments so they are invisible to readers but visible in source:

```markdown
<!-- TODO: verify: paragraph unclear due to PDF extraction artifact -->
<!-- TODO: figure: Figure 3-2 — confirm image file from manifest -->
<!-- TODO: footnote: footnote 4 text garbled on PDF page 23 -->
```

Never delete a TODO without completing the underlying check against the source PDF.

## Chapter frontmatter requirements

Every `docs/ja/*.md` must begin with:

```yaml
---
title: "第N章：日本語タイトル"
original_title: "Chapter N: English Title"
author: 'Andrew "bunnie" Huang'
copyright: "Copyright © 2003 by Xenatera LLC"
publisher: "No Starch Press"
source_pdf: "HackingTheXbox_Free.pdf"
pdf_page_range: "pp. XX–YY"
printed_page_range: "pp. XX–YY"
translation_status: draft  # draft | review | verified | final
license: "CC BY-NC-SA 1.0"
---
```

`pdf_page_range` = actual PDF page numbers (1-indexed).  
`printed_page_range` = page numbers printed in the book.

## Review checklist before marking a chapter complete

Before changing `translation_status` from `draft` to `review`:

- [ ] Every paragraph from the source PDF is present in the translation
- [ ] No paragraphs are summarized or condensed
- [ ] All figure numbers are preserved; all extracted figures are linked or TODO-marked
- [ ] All footnotes are translated and placed at end of file
- [ ] All sidebars and callout boxes are preserved
- [ ] All part numbers, URLs, hex values, code blocks are verbatim
- [ ] All technical terms match `glossary.tsv`
- [ ] Frontmatter `pdf_page_range` and `printed_page_range` are accurate
- [ ] Attribution block is present in footer
- [ ] `python3 scripts/validate_links.py` passes with zero errors
- [ ] No `<!-- TODO -->` comments remain that relate to missing content (placement TODOs for uncertain figure positions are acceptable)
